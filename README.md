# CRM Project

This project is a simple CRM (Customer Relationship Management) system designed to manage leads and accounts. It provides functionalities to save, update, delete, and retrieve leads. Additionally, it automatically deletes a lead when it is associated with an account.

## Modules

### Save Lead
The "Save Lead" module allows users to add new leads to the CRM system. Users can input relevant information such as lead name, contact details, and any additional notes.

### Update Lead
The "Update Lead" module enables users to modify existing lead information. Users can edit lead details such as contact information, notes, or any other relevant fields.

### Delete Lead
The "Delete Lead" module allows users to remove leads from the CRM system. This action removes all associated information about the lead from the database.

### Get Lead
The "Get Lead" module provides functionality to retrieve lead information from the CRM system. Users can search for leads based on various criteria such as lead name, contact details, or creation date.
